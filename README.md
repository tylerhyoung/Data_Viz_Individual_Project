# Data_Viz_Individual_Project
Santa Clara Spring 2018 Data Visualization Class Individual Project

The project will focus on Gun Violence in America. Based on the Vox article <https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts>, I attempt to use the same or newer data to improve three visualizations in a redesign and also to create three deceptive or counter argurments without changing the underlying data.

This project will consist of: 
  1. Problem Statement
  2. First Version of Redesign
  3. First Version of Deception
  4. Final Products(Revised Versions)

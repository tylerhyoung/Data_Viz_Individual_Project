## Critique and 'making of' thoughts

First in the presentation of the final data products, I tried to tie all three together under one link in a logical fashion using tableau's story functionality. I thought about what would make a cohesive and compelling argurment, something the vox article may have attempted to do but ended up being fragmented or repetitive with little flow. In my story I wanted to convey with the first product that America has more guns and more firearm deaths which is a trend seen among developed nations. Then the second chart is actually two bar charts to highlight that the US is unique in firearm murder rate but not overall crime rate. This is a preemptive rebuttle to the arguement that America has more gun related violence just because we have a higher total crime rate. Finally I wrap up the story with a visualization that hopefully shows that gun control laws could potentially be one solution to combatting the higher rates of gun related deaths.

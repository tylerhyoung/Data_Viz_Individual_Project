## Critique and 'making of' thoughts

First in the presentation of the final data products, I tried to tie all three together under one link in a logical fashion using tableau's story functionality. I thought about what would make a cohesive and compelling argurment, something the vox article may have attempted to do but ended up being fragmented or repetitive with little flow. In my story I wanted to convey with the first product that America has more guns and more firearm deaths which is a trend seen among developed nations. Then the second chart is actually two bar charts to highlight that the US is unique in firearm murder rate but not overall crime rate. I thought a potential rebuttle to my claim might be that America has more gun related violence just because we have a higher total crime rate. So in my second visualization I tried to preemptively counter that rebuttle and maintain the claim that America is unique in its gun violence. Finally I wrap up the story with a visualization that hopefully shows that gun control laws could potentially be one solution to combatting the higher rates of gun related deaths. In doing this I hoped to at least spur an actionable thought that some gun control, particuarly focused on child safety laws, could improve the situation. 

### Specifics: 
#### Data Product 1 "More Guns = More Gun Homicides"

Originally I graphed all the countries on three separate charts based on whether they were high, medium, or low ranking on the Human Development Index. But looking back at that data product, I realized I lost track of my primary focus, which was to highlight the United States gun problem. Also I removed the color on the data points and only kept a light red for the trend line, but if it was rendered in another color, or black and white, the message would still come across. I also made a decision to filter the data by the top 30 countries because I was running into some issues with all the labels rendering in such a tight cluster. In doing this I hoped to balance both showing enough data points to see a trend but not so many that only 10 country labels showed up. I also added two captions, one at the top which should be read first to establish where a reader is in the story and give high level description of what the graph is showing and the other caption at the bottom citing the data and my qualifiers for the reader who wants to go more in depth.

#### Data Product 2 "Firearm Murders by Country" & "Total Crime by Country"
